Android Security
================
Data encryption for Android devices
-----------------------------------

Mobile security is not something easily ignored. There are many forms of intrusion, 
starting from the WiFi sniffing to simply losing the device.

The goal of this part is to find the best way of storing sensitive data within 
an android device and a creation of AES128 and SHA256 encryption examples for 
an android application.
