GPS and geolocation
===================
Google Maps, Directions, and roads APIs
---------------------------------------

Many modern and widely used application would not be possible without the geolocation services. 
Our dynamic lives dictate the importance of geolocation and the data it can provide.

This part of the toolbox would include three layers of GPS usage. The first layer would provide 
the current location of the device. The second layer would tap even deeper into googleâ€™s API to 
calculate the best route between the current position and a set point, while the third layer 
should notify the user once he has reached his given destination.
